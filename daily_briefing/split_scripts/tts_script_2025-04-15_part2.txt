We propose a novel amplification mechanism for high harmonic generation (HHG)
in solids by leveraging bandgap engineering with momentum k-gaps. By
constructing a simple diatomic lattice featuring balanced, alternating gain and
loss profiles, facilitated by an array of four-level systems, we explore the
physics of k-gap-amplified Bloch oscillations in the intraband channel of
solid-state HHG. Through numerical simulations, we elucidate the coexistence of
amplification and harmonic radiation processes in a solid. Our finding reveals
that advanced bandgap engineering can define k-space optical devices - such as
Brillouin cavity, Bloch-Zener oscillator and k-gap amplifier - thereby enabling
the coherent manipulation of semiconductor radiation and high harmonic
generation in both semiconductor superlattices and artificial materials. Furthermore, we analyze the spectrogram and material realizations required for
amplifying solid-state HHG. These results underscore the potential of k-gap
band structure engineering to advance coherent light sources at extremely short
wavelengths. 이상으로 오늘의 논문 요약을 마칩니다. 감사합니다. 📢 오늘 소개할 논문은 'Extending Silicon Lifetime: A Review of Design Techniques for Reliable Integrated Circuits'입니다. 🔗 논문 링크는 http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21165v1 이고요,
