Live tracking of wildlife via high-resolution video processing directly
onboard drones is widely unexplored and most existing solutions rely on
streaming video to ground stations to support navigation. Yet, both autonomous
animal-reactive flight control beyond visual line of sight and/or
mission-specific individual and behaviour recognition tasks rely to some degree
on this capability. In response, we introduce WildLive -- a near real-time
animal detection and tracking framework for high-resolution imagery running
directly onboard uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). The system performs
multi-animal detection and tracking at 17fps+ for HD and 7fps+ on 4K video
streams suitable for operation during higher altitude flights to minimise
animal disturbance. Our system is optimised for Jetson Orin AGX onboard
hardware. It integrates the efficiency of sparse optical flow tracking and
mission-specific sampling with device-optimised and proven YOLO-driven object
detection and segmentation techniques. Essentially, computational resource is
focused onto spatio-temporal regions of high uncertainty to significantly
improve UAV processing speeds without domain-specific loss of accuracy.
Alongside, we introduce our WildLive dataset, which comprises 200k+ annotated
animal instances across 19k+ frames from 4K UAV videos collected at the Ol
Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. All frames contain ground truth bounding boxes,
segmentation masks, as well as individual tracklets and tracking point
trajectories. We compare our system against current object tracking approaches
including OC-SORT, ByteTrack, and SORT. Our multi-animal tracking experiments
with onboard hardware confirm that near real-time high-resolution wildlife
tracking is possible on UAVs whilst maintaining high accuracy levels as needed
for future navigational and mission-specific animal-centric operational
autonomy.

📢 오늘 소개할 논문은 'Amplifying solid-state high harmonic generations with momentum k-gaps in band structure engineering'입니다.

We propose a novel amplification mechanism for high harmonic generation (HHG)
in solids by leveraging bandgap engineering with momentum k-gaps. By
constructing a simple diatomic lattice featuring balanced, alternating gain and
loss profiles, facilitated by an array of four-level systems, we explore the
physics of k-gap-amplified Bloch oscillations in the intraband channel of
solid-state HHG. Through numerical simulations, we elucidate the coexistence of
amplification and harmonic radiation processes in a solid. Our finding reveals
that advanced bandgap engineering can define k-space optical devices - such as
Brillouin cavity, Bloch-Zener oscillator and k-gap amplifier - thereby enabling
the coherent manipulation of semiconductor radiation and high harmonic
generation in both semiconductor superlattices and artificial materials.
Furthermore, we analyze the spectrogram and material realizations required for
amplifying solid-state HHG. These results underscore the potential of k-gap
band structure engineering to advance coherent light sources at extremely short
wavelengths.

📢 오늘 소개할 논문은 'Extending Silicon Lifetime: A Review of Design Techniques for Reliable Integrated Circuits'입니다.

🔗 논문 링크는 http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21165v1 이고요,

Reliability has become an increasing concern in modern computing. Integrated
circuits (ICs) are the backbone of modern computing devices across industries,
including artificial intelligence (AI), consumer electronics, healthcare,
automotive, industrial, and aerospace. Moore Law has driven the semiconductor
IC industry toward smaller dimensions, improved performance, and greater energy
efficiency. However, as transistors shrink to atomic scales, aging-related
degradation mechanisms such as Bias Temperature Instability (BTI), Hot Carrier
Injection (HCI), Time-Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB), Electromigration
(EM), and stochastic aging-induced variations have become major reliability
threats. From an application perspective, applications like AI training and
autonomous driving require continuous and sustainable operation to minimize
recovery costs and enhance safety. Additionally, the high cost of chip
replacement and reproduction underscores the need for extended lifespans. These
factors highlight the urgency of designing more reliable ICs. This survey
addresses the critical aging issues in ICs, focusing on fundamental degradation
mechanisms and mitigation strategies. It provides a comprehensive overview of
aging impact and the methods to counter it, starting with the root causes of
aging and summarizing key monitoring techniques at both circuit and system
levels. A detailed analysis of circuit-level mitigation strategies highlights
the distinct aging characteristics of digital, analog, and SRAM circuits,
emphasizing the need for tailored solutions. The survey also explores emerging
software approaches in design automation, aging characterization, and
mitigation, which are transforming traditional reliability optimization.
Finally, it outlines the challenges and future directions for improving aging
management and ensuring the long-term reliability of ICs across diverse
applications.
